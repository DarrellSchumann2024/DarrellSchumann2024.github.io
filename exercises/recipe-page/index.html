         <h1>THE SAUCE AND COLESLAW</h1>
         <p>We are going to work backward with this recipe! Although the chicken
             is obviously the star of the recipe, making the sauce and coleslaw 
             comes first so the chicken can be enjoyed straight from the fryer. 
             Since fried chicken can be a bit heavier and in this case with 
             Nasvhille-style, very spiced, itâ€™s important to add some 
             refreshing more tangy elements. The coleslaw adds a nice crunch and
              refreshing taste while the sauce adds a creamy texture but is 
              also a bit tangy.
