         <h1>NASHVILLE HOT CHICKEN SANDWICHES</h1>

         <p>The hot chicken craze is taking over the food scene like wildfire 
            but let me tell you, the best Nashville chicken you can get is the 
            one you make at home and even better! From the crispy flakey fried 
            chicken to the creamy coleslaw and tangy sauce, this sandwich is 
            built to perfection in the flavor AND texture department. Now let's 
            dive into the secret formula for Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwiches!
         </p>
         <h1>THE SAUCE AND COLESLAW</h1>
         <p>We are going to work backward with this recipe! Although the chicken
             is obviously the star of the recipe, making the sauce and coleslaw 
             comes first so the chicken can be enjoyed straight from the fryer. 
             Since fried chicken can be a bit heavier and in this case with 
             Nasvhille-style, very spiced, it’s important to add some 
             refreshing more tangy elements. The coleslaw adds a nice crunch and
              refreshing taste while the sauce adds a creamy texture but is 
              also a bit tangy.
         </p>
         <br>
            <p>
                Let’s start with the sauce! In a bowl, mix together mayonnaise, 
            ketchup, garlic powder, Worcestershire sauce, and black pepper 
            until well combined. The color will be a light pink/orange color. 
            Raising Cane’s sauce is my favorite to enjoy with fried chicken 
            so this recipe is meant to be a copycat. Cover and set aside until 
            we need it!
        </p>
         <br>
         <p>
            As for the coleslaw, combine shredded cabbage and carrots in a bowl,
             then dress it with a mixture of mayonnaise, yellow mustard, apple 
             cider vinegar or lemon juice, sugar, salt, and black pepper. Let 
             the coleslaw chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes 
             before serving, allowing the flavors to develop. You can buy a 
             coleslaw blend from the grocery store or just purchase cabbage 
             and carrot and shred it yourself. Now that those components are 
             prepared, we can move on to the chicken!

             <h1>
                THE CHICKEN
            </h1>
            <p>The journey to crafting the perfect Nashville hot chicken 
                sandwich begins with the chicken itself. Start by marinating 
                boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs in buttermilk 
                for at least an hour, or preferably overnight, in the 
                refrigerator. This step not only tenderizes the chicken but 
                also infuses it with flavor. For the crispy coating, create a 
                seasoned flour mixture by combining all-purpose flour with 
                salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne 
                pepper, and paprika. For an extra crunch, consider adding a 
                touch of cornstarch or panko breadcrumbs to the mix. Dredge 
                the marinated chicken in the seasoned flour until fully 
                coated, then fry it in hot oil until golden brown and crispy 
                on the outside, yet juicy on the inside.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, let’s turn up the heat. Nashville hot chicken wouldn’t 
                be complete without its signature spicy seasoning. In a bowl,
                 mix together cayenne pepper, paprika, brown sugar, salt, 
                 black pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. To create a 
                 paste, add vegetable oil or melted butter to the spice 
                 mixture. For those who crave even more spice, a splash of 
                 hot sauce can be added to the mix. Adjust the spice level 
                 according to your preference, ensuring it strikes the perfect 
                 balance of heat and flavor.
            </p>
            <h1>ASSEMBLY</h1>
            <p>
                Now that all the components are ready, it’s time to assemble 
                the sandwich. Toast soft buns until golden brown and warm. 
                Spread a thin layer of the spicy sauce on the bottom bun, 
                then top it with a piece of crispy fried chicken. Add a few 
                slices of tangy pickles and a generous spoonful of coleslaw. 
                Finally, crown the sandwich with the top bun and press down 
                gently to secure all the layers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Serve your Nashville hot chicken sandwich alongside your 
                favorite sides, such as crispy fries, creamy coleslaw, or a 
                refreshing cucumber salad. Pair it with a cold beer or a 
                tall glass of sweet tea to help cool down the heat. With its 
                perfect combination of crispy, spicy chicken and tangy 
                toppings, this iconic Southern dish is sure to become a 
                favorite in your kitchen.
